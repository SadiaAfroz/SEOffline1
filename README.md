Scenario 1
In the burger shop Takeout at Dhanmondi many BUET students visit (often with their software
engineering sessional group mate) when they receive salary as private tutor. There, they have
option to choose different types of burger such as Chicken or Beef. Each type of burger has
specific type of patty, sauce, and cheese. When the customer gives order, the waiter prepares
burger with proper type of patty, sauce, and cheese so that the customer enjoys it and returns
next month when subsequent salary is received.

Scenario 2
Coffee Factory should create coffee of different types, CoffeeA, CoffeeB, CoffeeC.
CoffeeA, CoffeeB, CoffeeC, all these types must have milk as well as caffein. For sugar,
CoffeeA and CoffeeC do have sugar, but CoffeeB is for diabetic people and so should never
have sugar.
As a customer of CoffeeFactory you don't know any of this unnecessary detail, you just order
your preferred coffee using the produceCoffee function of CoffeeFactory.
Also, as CoffeeFactory owner is very skeptical about the world, you must also ensure that there
is only one CoffeeFactory in the whole world
